## About Me.


##### Hi. I am a MERN Stack developer who builds single-page and eCommerce applications.

It all started in 2017 where I first learnt to build static landing pages. Then I came to know about how servers work with the help of Python and now currently Node.js. That expanded my view upon the possibilities of creating huge applications

Then I slowly started engaging myself building single page application development, state management techniques using Redux.js and Context API and sideeffects using Redux-thunk and Redux-Saga,Node.js and Express.js and knowing how to connect to databases using MongoDB and Postgress.
